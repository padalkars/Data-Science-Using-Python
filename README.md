# Data-Science-Using-Python

This work comprises of some basic Data Extraction and performing statistical operations on different datasets in order to gain meaningful insights. There are 4 parts to it.

In the first part we have explored the Olympics dataset. The dataset comprises of details about the Medals won by various countries in Summer and Winter games.

In the second part we dive into the Energy Indicator Data Set, which is a list of indicators of [energy supply and renewable electricity production](Energy%20Indicators.xls) from the [United Nations]. A few noteworthy indicators are Citations per document,	H index,	Energy Supply,	Energy Supply per Capita,	% Renewable. We have gathered the following results to name a few, maximum % Renewable, ratio of Self-Citations to Total Citations, the correlation between the number of citable documents per capita and the energy supply per capita and average GDP over the last 10 years for each country.

In the third part a thorough analysis of recession was performed over the quarters of an year. GDP data of different countries was used to carry out the analysis. Hypothesis testing was carried out using t-test, to check whether the two different samples have the same average(expected) values.
